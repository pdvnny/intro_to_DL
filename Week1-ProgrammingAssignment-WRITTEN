PROBLEM 1 - Peer Review Problem - Single-Layer and Multilayer Perceptron Learning

**** PART A ****

i. NOT x1

I believe you can do this with a single-layer perceptron.
- Use w = -1
- Use threshold of 0 for the activation function

If x1 = True (i.e., > 0), then w * x1 would be False (i.e., <= 0)


ii. x1 NOR x2

This indicates

x1		x2		result
1		1		0
1		0		0
0		1		0
0		0		1

This should be possible with a single-layer perceptron by using..
- w1 and w2 equal to -1
- threshold for the activation function of -1

This would mean x1*w1 + x2*w2 results in "False" unless the output is 0, which is greater than -1,
which only happens if x1 and x2 are negative


iii. x1 XNOR x2

This indicates "not exclusive or"

x1		x2		result
1		1		1
1		0		0
0		1		0
0		0		1


This one is not linearly separable so it cannot be done with a single perceptron.


**** PART B ****

x1	x2	result
0   0   1
0   1   0
1   0   0
1   1   1

- The first condition can be checked using a NOR gate.
- The last condition can be checked using a AND gate.
- Then, if either of these results is true the the output should be true.
